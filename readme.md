# AXINITE

## What is it?

Electron (almost MVC) framework.

## Why did you make this?

I don't want to rewrite everything everytime I start something new with Electron.


## Where is model?

I'll add sqlite support in future.

## What is this usable for?

This is just an prototype. But it's okay if you want to learn about IPC
messaging or how to structure Electron project.

## I'm new to all of this, how do I run it?

You will need an linux (optional) and node.js. In terminal, run in project dir (where package.json is):

            npm install
            
Then to start electron app:

            npm start

## Have fun!
